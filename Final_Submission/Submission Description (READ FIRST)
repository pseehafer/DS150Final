Everything should be in the Github
The readme.md is in the Final_Submission File

In the DS 150 Capstone File it should include:
The Juypter Notebook
The Final Report for our project
The Presentation from class

We are unable to include the CSV because it is so large, so we will include it in submission comments.
Figures and Graphs should be generated when the notebook is ran.
