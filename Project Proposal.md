# Project Idea: [Your Project Title]
## Proposed by: Gavin Sorensen, Your name, Your name

## What question will you answer?
Are there any patterns to video game sales? For example the price of video games on average over time, price of games in different countries - discount applied to these countries versus US prices, average price of games on different consoles, genre and release date.

## Data source:
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets?search=steam+sales
- https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anandshaw2001/video-game-sales
- Steam API (https://store.steampowered.com/api/appdetails?appids={app_id}&cc={cc})

## What you'll create:
- Plots of our different questions
- For each plot we will have the coefficient of determination
- 

## Approach: What Python concepts and libraries will you use?
- mathplotlib Use: plots
- Pandas Use: Dataframes
- requests Use: pulling from steam API

## Team size needed: 
[3-4 total including you]
